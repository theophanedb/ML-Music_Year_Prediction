# ML-YearPredictionMSD

## The project
The goal of this Machine Learning project is to build a model to **predict the release year of a song**, based on **timbre audio features**.

Data was collected by the **Echo Nest API**, which loads music files and returns a JSON file containing much information. 

The dataset consists of 515345 instances, 90 predictors and 1 target : Year. 

## The repository contains
- A Jupyter Notebook where you can find all data processing, dataviz and machine learning algorithms
- An API
